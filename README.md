### 1. Introduction
The project aims to analyze the Pizza restaurant sales dataset to derive insight and facilitate data-driven decision making for anyone interest in data analysis.

### 2. Overview Dashboard

### 3. Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- pizza_id
- order_id
- pizza_name
- quantity
- order_date
- order_time
- unit_price
- total_price
- pizza_size
- pizza_category
- pizza_name

### 4. SQL

### 5. Python for EDA and Visualization
I utilized Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing, and effective data visualization to ensure a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the dataset.
To support this, the Python queries address four type of questions:
1. What is the most selling pizza?
2. What is the most selling category of pizza?
3. How is number of sales of each pizza size?
4. How is the distribution of total price by the category?
