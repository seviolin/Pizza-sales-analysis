### 1. Introduction
The project aims to analyze the Pizza restaurant sales dataset to derive insight and facilitate data-driven decision making for anyone interest in data analysis.

### 2. Overview Dashboard

The dataset contains the following columns:
- pizza_id
- order_id
- pizza_name
- quantity
- order_date
- order_time
- unit_price
- total_price
- pizza_size
- pizza_category
- pizza_name

### 4. SQL
SQL queries the sql queries contains a 10 type of queries:
1. KPI's
2. Total sales amount of pizza sold (by category)
3. Top 5 best-selling pizzas (by revenue)
4. Bottom 5 least-selling pizzas (by revenue)
5. Top 5 best-selling pizzas (by quantity)
6. Bottom 5 least-selling pizzas (by quantity)
7. Top 5 best-selling pizzas (by total orders)
8. Bottom 5 least-selling pizzas (by total orders)
9. Daily trend for total orders
10. Monthly trend for total orders

### 5. Python for EDA and Visualization
I utilized Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing, and effective data visualization to ensure a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the dataset.
To support this, the Python queries address four type of questions:
1. What is the most selling pizza?
2. What is the most selling category of pizza?
3. How is number of sales of each pizza size?
4. How is the distribution of total price by the category?
